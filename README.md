# Connect.US

## Introduction

There are many questions someone may have when relocating to the United States. 

Among the top, where should I live? 

Some are looking to find a place that are similar to their homeland. Some desire to try something new.

Some are looking for a real American experience while some are looking for cultural similarities to what they’re used to.

Our goal in this project, using data sets from the US Census Bureau, is to create a product that will allow people to find their next home based on Values, Variety and Vision for their life.


This site was built by a group of developers, data scientists and UXers that came together to solve the problem facing anyone relocating to this country for the first time.
